> SIMPLE CALCULATOR (Task-1)
A simple calculator is a basic electronic device or software tool designed to perform fundamental arithmetic operations. It typically handles:

1. **Addition (+)**: Combining two or more numbers to get a sum.
2. **Subtraction (−)**: Finding the difference between two numbers.
3. **Multiplication (×)**: Calculating the product of two or more numbers.
4. **Division (÷)**: Determining how many times one number is contained within another.

Some simple calculators also include functions for:

- **Percentage (%)**: Finding a percentage of a number or calculating percentage changes.
- **Square roots (√)**: Determining the square root of a number.
- **Memory functions**: Storing and recalling numbers.

Simple calculators are user-friendly and are often used in everyday tasks like budgeting, shopping, or basic calculations for work or school. They typically have a straightforward interface with buttons for digits, operations, and occasionally a few additional functions.
